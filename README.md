# Photo-Weather


By using a "Photo Weather" application, users can take a shot, add current weather data (such as a location's name, the current temperature, the weather, etc.) as a banner overlay, 
and then post the image on Facebook or Twitter.

The application uses Jetpack Navigation, Retrofit 2, View Binding, Coroutines, and MVVM design.
